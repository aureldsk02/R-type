\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \doxylink{classResourceManager}{Resource\+Manager} file. Contains the declaration of the \doxylink{classResourceManager}{Resource\+Manager} class. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{systems_8hpp}{systems.\+hpp}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the declaration of the different systems of the registry. Systems are functions that will be executed at each frame to update the state of all the components. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
