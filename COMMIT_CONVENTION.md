# Commit Message Convention

To ensure clarity and consistency in commit history, all commit messages must follow this convention:

- **add: message** → when adding a new feature, component, or functionality.  
- **fix: message** → when fixing a bug or issue.  
- **refactor: message** → when restructuring code without changing functionality.  
- **delete: message** → when removing files, features, or components.  
- **doc: message** → when updating or adding documentation.  

## Examples

- add: player movement system  
- fix: velocity component initialization bug  
- refactor: simplify registry component lookup  
- delete: old rendering pipeline  
- doc: update README with build instructions
